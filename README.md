## The 10 Questions

### Pillar A: Financial Analysis
1. Which product categories generate highest revenue vs highest profit margin?
2. How does discounting impact quantity sold and total profit?
3. Which categories show best ROI accounting for loss rates?

### Pillar B: Operations & Spoilage
4. Which products cost most money in waste?
5. Which items have high wholesale price variance but static selling prices?
6. Are there seasonal trends in spoilage by category?

### Pillar C: Customer Behavior
7. What are the busiest hours for sales? Which categories sell when?
8. Do specific items have higher returns on weekends vs weekdays?
9. Which hours have highest return rates?
10. Is there correlation between discount frequency and loss rate?

## How to Use

### **Opening the SQL Views**

1. Install PostgreSQL and DBeaver
2. Create a database with your transaction data (structure: Date, Item Code, Quantity Sold, Unit Price, Wholesale Price, Loss Rate, etc.)
3. Run `sql_views.sql` to create all 10 views
4. Query any view: `SELECT * FROM question_1_revenue_vs_margin;`

### **Opening the Power BI Dashboard**

1. Install Power BI Desktop
2. Open `retail_analytics_dashboard.pbix`
3. Connect to your PostgreSQL database (if using live connection) or load CSV exports
4. Use date filter on left sidebar to explore by year
5. Click navigation buttons to move between pages
6. Click "RESET" to clear all filters

### **Reading the Report**

1. Open `FINDINGS.md` for executive summary and recommendations
2. Reference specific metrics and impacts
3. Use as basis for stakeholder presentations
